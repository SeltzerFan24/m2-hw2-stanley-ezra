BOOTSTRAP GRID SYSTEM, UTILITIES, AND COMPONENTS 

I could not figure out how to change the two column layout into a three column layout based on the code I had written, and I could not find an answer, so I changed the column size to reduce the gutter width to make the website more visually pleasing

no outside sources were found that could help with this problem
